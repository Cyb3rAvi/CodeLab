# Project01-RaspberryPiSecurityCamera

## Overview

This project showcases a DIY smart security camera system built with a Raspberry Pi and Python. Designed to be both affordable and flexible, it offers real-time monitoring through motion detection and alerts.

## Key Features

- **Motion Detection:** The system identifies movement using a motion sensor.
- **Media Capture:** Automatically captures images and short video clips when motion is detected.
- **Email Alerts:** Sends real-time notifications with attached media to your email.

## Development Highlights

- **Integration:** Combined hardware (Raspberry Pi, camera, sensor) with Python scripts for seamless operation.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Implemented a notification system that ensures prompt email alerts.
- **User-Friendly:** Easy setup and scalable for various security needs.

## Learning Experience

This project enhanced my skills in integrating hardware with software, real-time data processing, and developing practical tech solutions.

## Future Plans

- **Cloud Storage:** To enable remote access and secure storage of captured media.
- **Advanced Detection:** Implementing AI for improved motion detection accuracy.
