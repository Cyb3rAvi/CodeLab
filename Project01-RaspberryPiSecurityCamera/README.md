# Project01-RaspberryPiSecurityCamera

## Overview

The Raspberry Pi Security Camera project is a smart motion sensor security system built using a Raspberry Pi and Python. This project was undertaken as a part of a solo initiative associated with Seneca College. The system is designed to detect motion, capture images and video clips, and send notifications via email. This project aims to offer a cost-effective and adaptable security solution suitable for various environments, such as homes or offices.

## Project Details

- **Objective:** Develop a motion-activated security camera system using a Raspberry Pi.
- **Components Used:**
  - **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, Camera Module, Motion Sensor
  - **Software:** Python for scripting, libraries like OpenCV for image processing, and smtplib for sending emails.
- **Features:**
  - **Motion Detection:** The system uses a motion sensor to detect any movement within its field of view.
  - **Image and Video Capture:** Upon detecting motion, the camera captures images and short video clips.
  - **Email Alerts:** Captured media is sent to a designated email address to provide real-time alerts.

## Development Process

1. **Planning and Research:** Defined project goals and researched suitable hardware and software components.
2. **Hardware Setup:** Configured the Raspberry Pi with a camera module and connected a motion sensor.
3. **Software Development:** Developed Python scripts to handle motion detection, media capture, and email notifications.
4. **Testing and Optimization:** Conducted extensive testing to ensure reliability and optimize performance.

## Challenges and Learning

This project provided valuable experience in integrating hardware with software, particularly in areas such as:
- Real-time data processing with limited hardware resources.
- Implementing secure and efficient email notifications.
- Optimizing motion detection and image capture in varying lighting conditions.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the system include:
- **Cloud Integration:** To store and access captured media remotely.
- **Enhanced Motion Detection:** Using machine learning for better accuracy.
- **Mobile Alerts:** Implementing push notifications for quicker alerts.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of creating a DIY security camera system using affordable hardware and open-source software. It has potential applications in personal and commercial security setups.
