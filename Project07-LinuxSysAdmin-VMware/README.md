# Project07-LinuxSysAdmin-VMware

## Overview

This project explores Linux system administration within a virtualized environment using VMware, conducted as part of a course at Seneca College. It involved setting up a complex virtual network with multiple nested virtual machines running CentOS 7 and leveraging advanced tools and modules for efficient server management.

## Key Features

- **Virtual Network Setup:** Established a virtual network with nested virtual machines, providing a comprehensive platform for testing and management.
- **Advanced Tools Integration:** Utilized Puppet for configuration management, Nagios Core for network monitoring, GlusterFS for scalable storage, Ansible for automation, and Docker Swarm for container orchestration.
- **Practical Application:** Demonstrated proficiency in Linux system administration through practical deployment and management of these tools.

## Technologies Used

- **Operating System:** CentOS 7
- **Virtualization:** VMware
- **Tools and Modules:** Puppet, Nagios Core, GlusterFS, Ansible, Docker Swarm

## Highlights

- **System Administration:** Gained hands-on experience in managing a complex Linux environment with advanced administrative tools.
- **Container Orchestration:** Implemented Docker Swarm to manage and orchestrate containerized applications.
- **Monitoring and Management:** Used Nagios Core for effective monitoring of network and system health, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expanded Automation:** Increasing the use of Ansible for broader automation of system administration tasks.
- **Security Hardening:** Implementing additional security measures to protect the virtual environment and data integrity.
