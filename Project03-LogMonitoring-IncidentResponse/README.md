# Project03-LogMonitoring-IncidentResponse

## Overview

This project explores the setup and management of a secure environment for log monitoring and incident response, using AlienVault OSSIM. The initiative was conducted as part of a hands-on learning experience at Seneca College, emphasizing the importance of monitoring and responding to security incidents.

## Key Features

- **Virtual Machine Setup:** Configured 3 virtual machines with diverse operating systems and specialized tools.
- **Secure Environment:** Established a secure, isolated network environment to protect against malware.
- **Log Monitoring:** Implemented AlienVault OSSIM to collect and analyze system logs, facilitating effective incident response.

## Technologies Used

- **Virtualization:** Various virtual machines with different OS setups
- **Security Tools:** AlienVault OSSIM for log monitoring and incident response

## Highlights

- **Incident Response:** Gained practical experience in handling security incidents through real-world simulations.
- **Environment Security:** Ensured a secure setup to prevent malware intrusion and protect data integrity.
- **Skill Development:** Enhanced understanding of security monitoring and incident response techniques.

## Future Enhancements
